A function is a block of organized reusable code used to perform a single action.

Like many programming languages such as JavaScript, you can add and reusable code used to perform a single action using many ways. 

This post will teach you seven approaches to write JavaScript functions: syntax and some examples.
I'll also discuss when you can use the different types efficiently, and also the pros and the cons. 

## Table of content

- 1 -  Function Declaration
- 2 - Function Expressions
- 3 - Shorthand method definition
- 4 - Constructors 
- 5 - Arrow function

## 1 - Function Declaration

A function declaration is the most common way to define a function in JavaScript. 

> To declare a function, you use the `function` keyword followed by an obligatory function name, a list of parameters in brackets, and a pair of curly braces to write the function code.

```javascript
function nameOfTheFunction(param1, param2, ...){
    console.log("Something")
   // line1
   ...
}
```
####  Example
```javascript
function isPositive(number){
    return num > 0;
}
```
The function `isPositive()` defines a variable `isPositive` in the current scope of execution with the identifier equal to the function name. That means that the variable `isPositive` holds the function object.

#### Function hoisting

One of the most important properties of the function declaration is the hoisting mechanism. It allows using the function before the declaration in the same scope.

#### Example
```javascript
multiplyNumbers(5,5)

function multiplyNumbers(a, b){
    return a * b;
}
```

Note that to execute a declared function, you'll need to invoke it. As you saw, you just need to write the name of the function followed by brackets containing the arguments if necessary.

## 2 - Function Expression

A function expression is closely similar to the syntax of the function declaration. 
> Using `var`, `const`, or `let` keyword, followed by the function name and affectation sign (`=` in JavaScript), you enter the keyword function followed by parameters in brackets and a pair of curly braces containing the function code.

```javascript
const functionName = function(param1, param2, ...){
    //code
}
```

Here is a clear example :

```javascript
const sum = function(a, b){
    return a + b;
}
sum(5, 6); // => 11
```
Function expressions are very useful if you want to write methods within objects. 

```javascript
const methods = {
    sum: function(a, b){
        return a + b;
    },
    substract: function(a, b){
        return a - b;
    }
}

methods.sum(5,6); // => 11
methods.substract(5,6); // => -1
```

Contrary to function declaration allowing **hoisting**, you can't call your function if you haven't defined it yet.

One of the main advantages of using a function expression is easy debugging. When your program will encounter an error, the stack trace will contain the name of the function.

## 3 - Shorthand function

Shorthand syntax has been introduced with  [ES2015](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/learn/)  and is quite similar to the getter, setter syntax. 

```javascript
const obj = {
	items:[],
	get(index){
		return this.items[index];
	},
	set(...elements){
		this.items.push(...elements)
	}
}

items.add("foo", "bar");
items.get(1) // => "bar"
```
> You can define them using the function name, followed by a list of parameters in a pair of parenthesis `()` followed by a pair of curly braces that delimits the body statements.

This function syntax is very common when working with objects. You call the function like this :

`object.functionName(...parameters)`.

### Pros
- Shorter syntax is easier to read;
- Name functions are created, contrary to function expression;

## 4 - Constructors
In JavaScript, a constructor is a function used to create objects.

> To create a constructor, you use the keyword function followed by the name of your function, always **camelCased** by convention, followed by a pair of parenthesis where you can add parameters, followed by a pair of curly braces describing the code logic.

#### Example 

```javascript
function shoes(size, mark){
	this.size = size;
	this.mark = mark;
};

let yeezy = new shoes(37, adidas);
console.log(yeezy.size); => 37
console.log(yeezy.mark); => 'adidas'
```

One of the most important things to notice here is the usage of the `this` and `new`. Here `this` refers to the `object` when this `object` is created.

```javascript
function vegetal(){
	this.type = "vegetal";
};

let tomato = new vegetal();

console.log(tomato.type); => "vegetal"
```

To create an object from a constructor function, we use the  `new`  keyword.

### Pros

- Can be used to create multiples objects that can be mutated without changing the parent. In this case, it can be effective than object expression. 

#### Example

```javascript
let vegetal = {
	this.type = "vegetal";
};

let tomato = vegetal();
tomato.type = "Fruit";
console.log(tomato.type); //=> "Fruit"
```

- If you want to add a property to objects derived from your constructor, you can do it easily.

#### Example

```javascript
function vegetal(){
	this.type = "vegetal";
}

let tomato = new vegetal();
let orange = new vegetal();
tomato.type = "Fruit";
orange.juice = true;

console.log(tomato.type); //=> "Fruit"
console.log(orange.juice); //=> true
console.log(vegetal.type, vegetal.juice); // => undefined, undefined
```
- If you want to add a new property to the constructor, just use `Object.prototype.property`.

#### Example

```javascript
function vegetal(){
	this.type = "vegetal";
}

let tomato = new vegetal();
let orange = new vegetal();
console.log(tomato.type, orange.type); //=> vegetal, vegetal

vegetal.prototype.isHealthy = true;
console.log(tomato.isHealthy, orange.isHealthy); //=> true, true
```

## 5 - Arrow Functions

Array functions is one of the most used features introduced in ES6. It allows developers to create functions in a cleaner way contrary to the function declaration.

```javascript
let sum = (a,b) => a+b;

let sum = function (a,b){
	return a + b;
};
```

```javascript
function person(){
  this.name = "John";
  showName = () => {
        console.log(this.name);
	}
}
let someone = new person()
```

Now, it's important to inform you:  `this` keyword is a little complex with arrow functions.
With regular function, `this` keyword represents the object that is called the function.
 
It can be the window, the document, or a button for example. 

However, with the arrow function, the `this` keyword always represents the object that defined the arrow function. 

Okay, it sounds a little bit complex. Let's see with some examples we'll try in the browser console : 

```javascript
// Declaring a normal function
function greetings() {
    console.log("Hello " + this);
};
greetings(); // => "Hello [object Window]"
```
Now, let's use an arrow function. 

```javascript
const greetings = () => console.log("Hello " + this);

greetings(); // => "Hello [object Window]"
```

The same result right ... And that's normal. `this` here represents the Object Window, because the function is defined in Object Window object scope. 
Let's create an arrow function with our own object. 

```javascript
const greetings = {
    greetUser: null,
    hello: function () {
        this.greetUser = () => { console.log(this) };
    }
};

greetings.hello(); // To initialize greetings.greetUser with an arrow function
greetings.greetUser(); // => Object { greetUser: greetUser(), hello: hello() }
```
### Pros 
- Reduces a lot of code and makes it more readable. Actually, the arrow functions are very effective when used for callbacks. 
- Having contextual `this`

### Cons
- Avoid using arrow functions for event handlers, object methods prototype methods, or functions that use the `arguments` object
