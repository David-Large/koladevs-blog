The first rule of Test-Driven-Development (TDD) is to write a test before coding the feature. It sounds more intuitive when doing some backend work, to be honest, but does it work when doing some frontend, particularly in React. ðŸš€

In this article, we'll explore TDD in React with a simple component. 

## The feature

In this article, we'll reproduce the following component. A simple -- and very ugly ðŸ¤§-- counter.

Well, it'll do the work for what we want to understand here because we are focusing more on the functionalities than the aesthetic.ðŸ’„

## Setup the project

First of all, create a simple React project. 

```shell
yarn create react-app react-test-driven-development
```

Once the project is created, make sure everything works by running the project. 

```shell
cd react-test-driven-development
yarn start
```

And you'll have something similar running at http://localhost:3000.

## Writing the Counter feature

Create a new directory in the `src` directory called `components`. This directory will contain the components we'll be writing. And inside the new directory, create a file called `Counter.test.js`. As stated earlier when doing TDD, we write tests before coding the feature. 
It helps establish a better architecture for the feature because you are forced to really think about what you are going to code and test.

### Description of the Counter component

The ideal component takes a prop called `value`. This value is then shown on the screen in a <p> tag. 
 
Great! Let's write the test first. 

### Writing the test

Inside the `Counter.test.js` add the following content. 

```js
import { render, screen } from '@testing-library/react';
import Counter from "Counter";
```

We start by importing the needed tools to write the test. Don't worry about the second line, we haven't created the `Counter` component yet. The goal of TDD is to make sure the test fails first before writing the feature.

With this, we can now write the first test.

```js
test('renders counter component', () => {
    render(<Counter value={2} />);
    const counterElement = screen.getByTestId("counter-test");
});
```

Here, we render the `Counter` component in the DOM and we retrieve the element. There will be two things to test here: 
- Is the component rendered? 
- Is the Counter showing exactly 2 as the value? 

```js
test('renders counter component', () => {
    render(<Counter value={2} />);
    const counterElement = screen.getByTestId("counter-test");
    
    // Testing that the counter element is rendered
    expect(counterElement).toBeInTheDocument();

    // Testing that the counter element has the correct value
    expect(counterElement).toHaveTextContent("2");
});
```

Great! Now in the command line, run the following command to run the tests.

```shell
yarn test
```
The command will fail naturally.

Great! Let's move on and write the component. 

### Writing the component

Inside the component directory, create a new file called `Counter.jsx`. And inside this file add the following content. 

```js
import React from "react";


// This is the component we are testing

function Counter(props) {

    const { value } = props;
    return (
        <p data-testid="counter-test">
            {value}
        </p>
    );
}

export default Counter;
```

Now run the tests again and everything should be green. 

![Nice! Nice!](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1649577792532/OsusMsewl.png)

Nice! Nice! We've done a great job. The next step is to add this component to the `App.js` and with a `button` to trigger a state change. And we'll also go TDD for this. 

> You may have an issue with a similar error in the terminal after running the tests. 
```shell
    Warning: ReactDOM.render is no longer supported in React 18...
```

## Writing the full Counter feature

In this case, we are now adding a button to modify the value in `Counter.jsx`. As we are going to write directly the code in `App.js`, let's write the test first in the `App.test.js` file.

### Requirements

The requirements of this feature are: 
- Click on a Button to increase the shown value by 1

Pretty simple right? Let's write the test first.

### Writing the test

The `testing-library` provides tools we can use to trigger actions on a Button. Very nice! 

Let's start by importing the needed tools. As we are going to trigger a click event on the screen ( clicking the button ) to increase the value in the counter, the tests functions will be asynchronous.

```jsx
import { render, screen } from '@testing-library/react';
import App from './App';
import userEvent from "@testing-library/user-event";
```

The `UserEvent` is a tool that simulates a user triggering actions such as clicking, typing, and much more. And here's the test.

```jsx
import { render, screen } from '@testing-library/react';
import App from './App';
import userEvent from "@testing-library/user-event";

describe('Render the counter with Button', () => {
  render(<App />);

  it("render counter", async () => {
    const appElement = screen.getByTestId('app-test');
    expect(appElement).toBeInTheDocument();

    // Testing that the counter element has the correct default value
    const counterElement = screen.getByTestId('counter-test');
    expect(counterElement).toHaveTextContent('0');

    // Retrieving the button element
    const buttonElement = screen.getByTestId('button-counter-test');
    expect(buttonElement).toBeInTheDocument();

    // Triggering the click event on the button

    await userEvent.click(buttonElement);

    // Testing that the counter element has the correct value
    expect(counterElement).toHaveTextContent('1');
  })
});
```

Great! The tests will fail normally. Let's write the feature.

### Writing the full counter feature

Inside the `App.js` file, add the following content.

```js
import React from "react";
import Counter from "./components/Counter";

function App() {

  const [count, setCount] = React.useState(0);

  return (
    <div data-testid="app-test">
      <Counter value={count} />
      <button data-testid="button-counter-test" onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increase</button>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```
We are using React.useState to manage to track and modify the state. 
After that, run all the tests again. And it should be green.ðŸŸ¢

And congratulations! We've just done some React using TDD. In the next article, we'll dive deeper into TDD but with Redux and thunk. We are going to set up a full testing environment independent of a remote backend. ðŸ”¥

Pretty interesting, right? Well, if you want to get informed about it, I am starting a newsletter. If I pass 10 subscribers, I am kick-starting it weekly.ðŸš€
