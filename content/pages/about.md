## こんにちは (Kon'nichiwa) 👋

Hello! I'm **Kolawole Mangabo**, a software engineer with more than 4 years of experience. I enjoy creating things that live on the internet, whether that be websites, applications, or anything in between. <br>

I seek to innovate, reduce waste, automate the understood, and push the envelope of understanding to new horizons. I do this primarily in a software realm with a team, but the basic ideas of **maximize the win, minimize the loss, and first do no harm** have worked everywhere I've been so far.

And when I am not coding, you can find me publishing articles on [medium](https://medium.com/@koladev/) or [DEV](https://dev.to/koladev).

Here are a few technologies I've been working with recently:

- Python
- Django
- Node
- React / React Native
- Docker & AWS

And you can contact me here.👇‍
