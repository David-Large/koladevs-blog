#### https://covidafrica.info/
The main objective is to be able to transform the data we collect into useful information whether for research or out of curiosity.
The project is open-source and any suggestion or criticism is welcome. 
I worked on this project using Python to collect and clean data, and then I made it available throught an API made with [Masonite FrameWork](https://docs.masoniteproject.com/). 
I also understand the concern about SPA applications and SEO, then I decided to use NuxtJs to build the website to display the data collected from the API.
NB: The data collected is also available through an API or in CSV format.
