                Hello! I'm Kolawole Mangabo, a software engineer with 4 years of experience.

                I enjoy creating things that live on the internet, whether that be websites, applications, or anything
                in
                between.<br> My goal is to always build products that provide pixel-perfect, performant experiences.
                <br>
                And when I am not coding, you can find me publishing articles on <a
                    href="https://medium.com/@koladev/">medium</a> or <a href="https://dev.to/koladev">DEV</a>.
                <br>
                Currently, I am a part of a team of 8 as a full-stack engineer where I focus on accessibility, component-driven approaches, and building systems that can scale with ease.
